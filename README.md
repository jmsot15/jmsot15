## üëã About Me

Recent Computer Science graduate with a unique background in healthcare and software development. My experience spans full-stack development (ASP.NET Core, React, Flutter, MongoDB) and medical laboratory operations, giving me a distinctive edge in creating technology solutions that address real-world healthcare challenges. I bring a valuable perspective that bridges technical implementation with healthcare domain knowledge, ensuring applications are not just technically sound but truly serve end-user needs in critical environments. This interdisciplinary background enables me to communicate effectively with both technical teams and healthcare stakeholders.

Looking for web development, backend, or full-stack roles where I can leverage my dual expertise to build meaningful applications‚Äîparticularly interested in opportunities where my healthcare insights can inform innovative technical solutions.
